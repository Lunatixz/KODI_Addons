[B]Advanced Channel Rules:[/B]
Advanced Channel Rules enable you to do various things such as changing the channel name, showing/hiding the channel logo, playing shows in order, scheduling or excluding shows and interleaving other channels, shows, adverts or bumpers.

[COLOR=blue][B]Best-Effort Channel Scheduling[/B][/COLOR] - Want to watch The Daily Show every night at 7:00? Schedule your channel to play it.

[COLOR=blue][B]Channel Logo[/B][/COLOR] - Does most of the videos on your CBS channel have the logo encoded into the video?
Disable the drawing of the logo on that channel. (It will still show on the EPG)

[COLOR=blue][B]Don't include a show[/B][/COLOR] - Exclude a show from your channel.

[COLOR=blue][B]Don't play this channel[/B][/COLOR] - Since some rules use other channels as modifiers (scheduling and interleaving), you may
not want that channel to actually be visible.

[COLOR=blue][B]Force Random / Real-Time / Resume[/B][/COLOR] - While most people use Real-Time mode (as recommended), you can now have a channel
be different from the rest. Not to be confused with random sorting this rule simply starts each channel from a random position on each load. 

[COLOR=blue][B]Include Strms[/B][/COLOR] - Enable or Disable strms on a per channel basis

[COLOR=blue][B]Include BCT's[/B][/COLOR] - Enable or Disable BCT's on a per channel basis

[COLOR=blue][B]Filter 3D Media[/B][/COLOR] - Enable or Disable 3D Content on a per channel basis

[COLOR=blue][B]Interleave another channel[/B][/COLOR] - Are you one of those people that likes bumpers? Create a channel that only has the
bumpers and use this rule on your main channel to interleave those bumpers in between your shows. This rule is also useful for Adverts. (More on Interleaving in the next chapter)

[COLOR=blue][B]Only play unwatched Items[/B][/COLOR] - If the channel contents change a lot, there's no reason to watch the same shows over and
over. Hide things you've watched from this channel with ease.

[COLOR=blue][B]Only play watched Items[/B][/COLOR] - Don't want to spoil a movie by accidentally seeing part of the middle? Hide shows that
haven't been watched yet.

[COLOR=blue][B]Pause when Not watching[/B][/COLOR] - Don't want to miss an episode of The Big Bang Theory? Make sure that if you're not
watching it, it stays paused. This rule goes great with the "Play shows in order" and "Force resume" rules.

[COLOR=blue][B]Play shows in Order[/B][/COLOR] - Now you can make sure that when you're watching Top Chef, the next episode that comes
on will actually be the next episode in the series.

[COLOR=blue][B]Set Channel Name[/B][/COLOR] - Useful for setting the name to a channel that was created from a Directory.

[COLOR=blue][B]Reset every x Hours[/B][/COLOR] - Causes the channel to automatically be rebuilt every x hours. Recommend use with Settop Box Mode.
